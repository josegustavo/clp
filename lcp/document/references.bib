	abstract = {This paper presents a new hybrid genetic algorithm for solving the container loading problem in the general case, precisely when the boxes have no orientation constraints. In order to improve the genetic algorithm efficiency, we developed a hybrid method, based on deterministic approaches combining the wall-building, level-slice approach and strip packing. A serie of experiments was achieved on 47 related benchmarks from the OR-Library. We could reach an average utilization of 94.47{\%} and an average computation time of 840s on a 1.7 GHz core duo.},

abstract = {The paper presents a genetic algorithm (GA) for the container loading problem. The main ideas of the approach are first to generate a set of disjunctive box towers and second to arrange the box towers on the floor of the container according to a given optimization criterion. The loading problem may include different practical constraints. The performance of the GA is demonstrated by a numerical test comparing the GA and several other procedures for the container loading problem.}
