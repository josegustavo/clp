  abstract = {The number of publications in the area of Cutting and Packing (C&P) has increased considerably over the last two decades. The typology of C&P problems introduced by Dyckhoff [Dyckhoff, H., 1990. A typology of cutting and packing problems. European Journal of Operational Research 44, 145–159] initially provided an excellent instrument for the organisation and categorisation of existing and new literature. However, over the years also some deficiencies of this typology became evident, which created problems in dealing with recent developments and prevented it from being accepted more generally. In this paper, the authors present an improved typology, which is partially based on Dyckhoff’s original ideas, but introduces new categorisation criteria, which define problem categories different from those of Dyckhoff. Furthermore, a new, consistent system of names is suggested for these problem categories. Finally, the practicability of the new scheme is demonstrated by using it as a basis for a categorisation of the C&P literature from the years between 1995 and 2004.}

A number of examples are given. Two approaches aimed at addressing some of the present limitations are discussed. One is designed to produce stable, evenly distributed packing patterns; the other caters for multi-drop loads. A comprehensive performance analysis using both published and randomly generated test problems is presented. The procedure used to create the latter is described in full to enable replication. It is shown that the two methods, when combined, provide a powerful and versatile tool.}

  abstract = {In this paper, we address a real problem of packing boxes into a multi-compartment container, in which the boxes must be delivered to customers in a predefined route. This problem arises, for example, in the distribution of beverages (packed in “boxes”) by trucks whose container has multiple compartments. The objective is to find a feasible packing plan that minimizes the handling of boxes inside the container along the whole truck route. The following practical constraints must be met: orientation of the boxes, cargo stability, load bearing strength of the boxes and load balancing. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study focusing on a vehicle packing problem with multi-compartment containers in the context of beverage distribution. To solve this problem, we present a hybrid approach which consists of a heuristic method based on the generation of horizontal layers and on the solution of mixed integer linear programming models. Computational tests were performed with this approach and a large variety of instances based on real data from a soft drink company. The results show that the approach is able to find feasible solutions for all instances considered under all constraints, contrary to what was observed in practice with the manual procedures available in the company. In practice, if a feasible solution is not obtained, it is necessary to change the predefined route plan and/or to consider an additional new delivery route and/or to use a solution that violates some of the constraints involved. In this sense, the proposed solution approach has good potential for being embedded into existing expert and intelligent systems for supporting the decision making process.}

  abstract = {The Container Loading Problem (CLP) literature has traditionally evaluated the dynamic stability of cargo by applying two metrics to box arrangements: the mean number of boxes supporting the items excluding those placed directly on the floor (M1) and the percentage of boxes with insufficient lateral support (M2). However, these metrics, that aim to be proxies for cargo stability during transportation, fail to translate real-world cargo conditions of dynamic stability. In this paper two new performance indicators are proposed to evaluate the dynamic stability of cargo arrangements: the number of fallen boxes (NFB) and the number of boxes within the Damage Boundary Curve fragility test (NB_DBC). Using 1500 solutions for well-known problem instances found in the literature, these new performance indicators are evaluated using a physics simulation tool (StableCargo), replacing the real-world transportation by a truck with a simulation of the dynamic behaviour of container loading arrangements. Two new dynamic stability metrics that can be integrated within any container loading algorithm are also proposed. The metrics are analytical models of the proposed stability performance indicators, computed by multiple linear regression. Pearson’s r correlation coefficient was used as an evaluation parameter for the performance of the models. The extensive computational results show that the proposed metrics are better proxies for dynamic stability in the CLP than the previous widely used metrics.}

In this paper, we present mixed integer linear programming models for the container loading problem that consider the vertical and horizontal stability of the cargo and the load bearing strength of the cargo (including fragility). The models can also be used for loading rectangular boxes on pallets where the boxes do not need to be arranged in horizontal layers on the pallet. A comprehensive performance analysis using optimization software with 100s of randomly generated instances is presented. The computational results validate the models and show that they are able to handle only problems of a moderate size. However, these models might be useful to motivate future research exploring other solution approaches to solve this problem, such as decomposition methods, relaxation methods, heuristics, among others.}

The approach uses a maximal-space representation to manage the free spaces in the container. The proposed algorithm hybridizes a novel placement procedure with a multi-population genetic algorithm based on random keys. The BRKGA is used to evolve the order in which the box types are loaded into the container and the corresponding type of layer used in the placement procedure. A heuristic is used to determine the maximal space where each box is placed. A novel procedure is developed for joining free spaces in the case where full support from below is required. The approach is extensively tested on the complete set of test problem instances of Bischoff and Ratcliff [1] and Davies and Bischoff [2] and is compared with 13 other approaches. The test set consists of 1500 instances from weakly to strongly heterogeneous cargo. The computational experiments demonstrate that not only the approach performs very well in all types of instance classes but also it obtains the best overall results when compared with other approaches published in the literature.}

This article considers a three-dimensional bin packing problem in which objects of various volumes are packed into a single bin to maximize the number of objects packed. The bin packing problem initially appears fairly simple; however, scholars have found its behavior rather complex. The formulated packing strategy seeks to minimize the number of cuboid spaces generated during the packing process by matching the object’s height, length, or width with the dimensions of the packing space. A hybrid genetic algorithm was used to solve the three-dimensional bin packing problem with this packing strategy. The results under the proposed algorithm were compared to various sets of computational results found in academic papers related to this subject.}

  abstract = {The container loading problem (CLP) intends to arrange a set of boxes into a container by considering different aspects, such as the dimension and weight of the box, capacity of the container, etc. In the multi-destination delivery, box arrangement should also consider routing, or delivery order. In addition, it is crucial to balance the boxes for safety in order to avoid traffic accident. Therefore, in order to overcome the aforementioned problems, this study proposes a mathematical model with two objectives, maximizing container’s utilization and minimizing truck’s unbalance force penalty. The proposed model also considers some practical constraints including geometry, maximum weight, and delivery order, or loading priority. Two metaheuristics, non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA II) and multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm (MOPSO) are employed to solve the proposed model and verified by using seven benchmark datasets in terms of hypervolume and spacing. The experimental results show that both algorithms have their own merits.}

In addition, our proposal deals with constraints on the dimensions of the container, whether every box can be rotated in any of the three dimensions, the maximum load bearing strength and also the minimum stability required.},

The main ideas of the approach are first to generate a set of disjunctive box towers and second to arrange the box towers on the floor of the container according to a given optimization criterion. The loading problem may include different practical constraints. The performance of the GA is demonstrated by a numerical test comparing the GA and several other procedures for the container loading problem.},

  abstract = {The load balance aspect of the Container Loading Problem (CLP) has been handled in an simplified way in the literature. Either load balance has been treated as a soft constraint or the geometrical centre of the container has been assumed to be the ideal location for the centre of gravity of the cargo, or both, which does not meet regulatory directives and transportation legislation. In this paper, we treat load balance as a hard constraint and adopt vehicle specific diagrams that define the feasibility domain for the location of the centre of gravity of the cargo, according to the vehicle specific technical characteristics, thus fulfilling and complying with real-world regulations and legislation. We propose a multi-population biased random-key genetic algorithm (BRKGA), with a new fitness function that takes static stability and load balance into account. Extensive computational experiments were performed with different variants of the proposed approach. Also solutions taken from the literature were evaluated in terms of load balance. The computational results show that it is possible to obtain stable and load balanced solutions without compromising the performance in terms of container volume utilization, and demonstrate also the advantage in incorporating load balance in the packing generation algorithm.}

We propose a critical analysis of the main findings and contributions, mainly from a European perspective. Starting with the roots of the area that can be traced back to the classical philosophers, we follow the historical path of heuristics and metaheuristics in the field of operations research and list the main milestones, up to the latest proposals to hybridize metaheuristics with machine learning. We pay special attention to the theories that changed our way of thinking about problem solving, and to the role played by the European Journal of Operational Research in the development of these theories. Our approach emphasizes methodologies and their connections with related areas, which permits to identify potential lines of future research.}

The aim of the LNS algorithm is to provide packing solutions that can be adopted by many logistics companies. The LNS algorithm can handle a set of side constraints such as orientation, stacking, and separation as well as weight limit, loading priorities, and stability to address the issues arising for loading the items. The packing solution is also visualised and animated using an Excel workbook to help the workers for loading of the items. Finally, the authors present a comparison between the performance of the LNS algorithm and the state-of-the-art algorithms from the literature based on benchmark data sets. The results demonstrate the quality of the solutions achieved by the LNS algorithm.}

  abstract = {This article presents PackageCargo. A modular open-source application developed using the Unity game engine to calculate, visualize, and save efficient packing patterns to instances of the Container Loading Problem (CLP). The packing patterns are obtained through approximate optimization algorithms (metaheuristics). Additionally, the proposed tool allows us to estimate cargo stability metrics through the implementation of mathematical models and verify the results of said models using a simulation environment built with the PhysX library. The goal of this application was to create a usable decision support system suitable for industrial purposes as well as a platform for academic research. It is offering a modifiable framework that can adapt to the necessities of its users, saving them software development time while continuing to extend PackageCargo through community contributions. The resulting application was compared with commercial software solutions. Furthermore, each module was tested using the most successful approaches found in literature as benchmarks. The packing module was compared against the top-performing algorithm published to date, obtaining similar results in similar computational times. The simulation module for cargo stability was benchmarked against high-performance simulation software, validating its accuracy and performance. Accordingly, PackageCargo was found to have a competitive feature set useful in both academic and commercial settings. As future work, it is proposed to combine the different modules to solve more sophisticated variants of the CLP, like the container loading problem constrained to weight distribution profiles.}
