abstract = {We present algorithms for the following three-dimensional (3D) guillotine cutting problems: unbounded knapsack, cutting stock and strip packing. We consider the case where the items have fixed orientation and the case where orthogonal rotations around all axes are allowed. For the unbounded 3D knapsack problem, we extend the recurrence formula proposed by [1] for the rectangular knapsack problem and present a dynamic programming algorithm that uses reduced raster points. We also consider a variant of the unbounded knapsack problem in which the cuts must be staged. For the 3D cutting stock problem and its variants in which the bins have different sizes (and the cuts must be staged), we present column generation-based algorithms. Modified versions of the algorithms for the 3D cutting stock problems with stages are then used to build algorithms for the 3D strip packing problem and its variants. The computational tests performed with the algorithms described in this paper indicate that they are useful to solve instances of moderate size.}

We review all literatures published in this area, and explain our unique problem raised from an industry partner. As constructive heuristic remains uncontrollable to us, we design improvement algorithms both to and not to intervene with how constructive heuristic works, namely iterated local search and beam search. New benchmark data sets for multiple containers problem are generated to fill the shortage of challenging data sets. Computational results for homogeneous containers problem indicate that while both approaches work on our problem, beam search remains a favourable choice. We also extend our algorithms to solve heterogeneous containers problem.}

abstract="Cutting and Packing (C{\&}P) problems arise in many industrial and logistics applications, whenever a set of small items, with different shapes, has to be assigned to large objects with specific shapes so as to optimize some objective function. Besides some characteristics common to combinatorial optimization problems, the distinctive feature of this field is the existence of a geometric subproblem, to ensure that the items do not overlap and are completely contained in the large objects. The geometric tools required to deal with this subproblem depend on the shapes (rectangles, circles, irregular) and on the specific conditions of the problem being solved. In this chapter, after an introduction that describes and classifies Cutting and Packing problems, we review the basic strategies that have appeared in the literature for designing constructive algorithms, local search procedures, and metaheuristics for problems with regular and irregular shapes.",

abstract = {The knapsack container loading problem is the problem of loading a subset of rectangular boxes into a rectangular container of fixed dimensions such that the volume of the packed boxes is maximized. A new heuristic based on the wall-building approach is proposed, which decomposes the problem into a number of layers which again are split into a number of strips. The packing of a strip may be formulated and solved optimally as a Knapsack Problem with capacity equal to the width or height of the container. The depth of a layer as well as the thickness of each strip is decided through a branch-and-bound approach where at each node only a subset of branches is explored. Several ranking rules for the selection of the most promising layer depths and strip widths are presented and the performance of the corresponding algorithms is experimentally compared for homogeneous and heterogeneous instances. The best ranking rule is then used in a comprehensive computational study involving large-sized instances. These computational results show that instances with a total box volume up to 90% easily may be solved to optimality, and that average fillings of the container volume exceeding 95% may be obtained for large-sized instances.}
